# `backtrack`

A meta-tactic for running backtracking search, given a non-deterministic tactic
`alternatives : MVarId → MetaM (List (MetaM (List MVarId)))`.

Here the outermost list gives us alternative solutions to the input goal.
The innermost list is then the new subgoals generated in that solution.
The additional `MetaM` allows for deferring computation.

`backtrack alternatives goals` will recursively try to solve all goals in `goals`,
and the subgoals generated, backtracking as necessary.

In its default behaviour, it will either solve all goals, or fail.
A customisable `suspend` hook in `BacktrackConfig` allows suspend a goal (or subgoal),
so that it will be returned instead of processed further.
Other hooks `proc` and `discharge` (described in `BacktrackConfig`) allow running other
tactics before `alternatives`, or if all search branches from a given goal fail.

See also `nondeterministic`, an alternative implementation of the same idea,
but with simpler flow control, and no trace messages.

Currently only `solveByElim` is implemented in terms of `backtrack`.

Attempts to solve the `goals`, by recursively calling `alternatives g` on each subgoal that appears.
`alternatives` returns a list of list of goals (wrapped in `MetaM`).
The outermost list corresponds to alternative outcomes,
while the innermost list is the subgoals generated in that outcome.

`backtrack` performs a backtracking search, attempting to close all subgoals.

Further flow control options are available via the `Config` argument.

## Implementation notes

This is broken down into two functions: `getBestOfOneAlt` and `getBestOfAlts`.

`getBestOfAlts` folds over the different `alternatives` in the context of an optional `bestSize?`
and some `init : β`, representing the initial piece of `β` accumulated before we reached this
particular call. We can assume `! exceeds (size (init)) sizeBest`. At each stage of the fold, it
exposes some prior `newBestSize?` (which begins as `bestSize?`) and compares this to
`size (incorporate init newerBest)`. We need to stop if the value we're calculating ever exceeds
the best size.

Let's consider examining the first alternative. Using `≤` for `(not <| exceeds · ·)`, `|a|` for
`size a`, `+` for `incorporate`, and abusing notation liberally, we need to ensure that
(1) `∀ best ∈ best?, |init + newFromAlt₁| ≤ |best|`, where `newFromAlt₁` is the new piece of `β` we
get from the first alternative. When we enter the second alternative, we need to satisfy the next
version of this ((2.1) `∀ best ∈ Option β, |init + newFromAlt₂| ≤ |best|`), and also satisfy
(2.2) `∀ newFromAlt₁ ∈ newFromAlt₁?, |init + newFromAlt₂| ≤ |init + newFromAlt₁|`—that is, we also
can't be worse than any `newFromAlt₁` we might have found. However, we ensured that (1) was the
case in the first alternative, and (1) ∧ (2.2) ⇒ (2.1) as long as `exceeds` is transitive, so we
may as well just check (2.2).

In `getBestOfOneAlt`, we're building the prior `init` as we fold through the list. Suppose we
started `getBestOfOneAlt` with `init := init₀`, and we've accumulated `current : β` (starting from
`cfg.bot`) so far as we've folded through the list. Say we're examining a list element `a`. We
generate `← alternatives a` and pass down `init := init₀ + current` to `getBestOfAlts`. If we
return from `getBestOfAlts` with some `newFromAlt`, we update `current` to `current + newFromAlt`
and continue folding, then eventually return this (assuming we don't exceed the maximum size along
the way, in which case we fail).

We assume there's a function `∔` which lets `size` distribute over `+`, i.e. `|a + b| = |a| ∔ |b|`.
Then we need only receive `|init₀|` at the start of `getBestOfOneAlt`, and need only pass down
`|init₀ + current|` to `getBestOfAlts` at each list element. This might not always be the case for
all tasks we'd like to handle, but we'll leave handling that efficiently for future work; the
current implementation thus only passes down `currentSize := |init₀ + current|`, and demands a
function `add` which represents `∔`.

We use a tree `Later'` with a computed field, which lets us store the size in the constructor and
retrieve it in constant time. We then fold over the result with `incorporate` later. This lets us
avoid expensive `incorporate` operations inside alternatives which won't work out.
