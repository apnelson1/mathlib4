# Explicit limits and colimits

This file collects some constructions of explicit limits and colimits in `CompHaus`,
which may be useful due to their definitional properties.

So far, we have the following:
- Explicit pullbacks, defined in the "usual" way as a subset of the product.
- Explicit finite coproducts, defined as a disjoint union.

variable {X Y B : CompHaus.{u}} (f : X ⟶ B) (g : Y ⟶ B)

The pullback of two morphisms `f,g` in `CompHaus`, constructed explicitly as the set of
pairs `(x,y)` such that `f x = g y`, with the topology induced by the product.

Construct a morphism to the explicit pullback given morphisms to the factors
which are compatible with the maps to the base.
This is essentially the universal property of the pullback.

The coproduct of a finite family of objects in `CompHaus`, constructed as the disjoint
union with its usual topology.

To construct a morphism from the explicit finite coproduct, it suffices to
specify a morphism from each of its factors.
This is essentially the universal property of the coproduct.
