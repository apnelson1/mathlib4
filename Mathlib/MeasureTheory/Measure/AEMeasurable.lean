# Almost everywhere measurable functions

A function is almost everywhere measurable if it coincides almost everywhere with a measurable
function. This property, called `AEMeasurable f μ`, is defined in the file `MeasureSpaceDef`.
We discuss several of its properties that are analogous to properties of measurable functions.
