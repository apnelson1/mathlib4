/-! # Mutually singular measures

Two measures `μ`, `ν` are said to be mutually singular (`MeasureTheory.Measure.MutuallySingular`,
localized notation `μ ⟂ₘ ν`) if there exists a measurable set `s` such that `μ s = 0` and
`ν sᶜ = 0`. The measurability of `s` is an unnecessary assumption (see
`MeasureTheory.Measure.MutuallySingular.mk`) but we keep it because this way `rcases (h : μ ⟂ₘ ν)`
gives us a measurable set and usually it is easy to prove measurability.

In this file we define the predicate `MeasureTheory.Measure.MutuallySingular` and prove basic
facts about it.
