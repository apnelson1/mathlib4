# Derivative is measurable

In this file we prove that the derivative of any function with complete codomain is a measurable
function. Namely, we prove:

* `measurable_set_of_differentiable_at`: the set `{x | differentiable_at 𝕜 f x}` is measurable;
* `measurable_fderiv`: the function `fderiv 𝕜 f` is measurable;
* `measurable_fderiv_apply_const`: for a fixed vector `y`, the function `λ x, fderiv 𝕜 f x y`
  is measurable;
* `measurable_deriv`: the function `deriv f` is measurable (for `f : 𝕜 → F`).

We also show the same results for the right derivative on the real line
(see `measurable_deriv_within_Ici` and ``measurable_deriv_within_Ioi`), following the same
proof strategy.

## Implementation

We give a proof that avoids second-countability issues, by expressing the differentiability set
as a function of open sets in the following way. Define `A (L, r, ε)` to be the set of points
where, on a ball of radius roughly `r` around `x`, the function is uniformly approximated by the
linear map `L`, up to `ε r`. It is an open set.
Let also `B (L, r, s, ε) = A (L, r, ε) ∩ A (L, s, ε)`: we require that at two possibly different
scales `r` and `s`, the function is well approximated by the linear map `L`. It is also open.

We claim that the differentiability set of `f` is exactly
`D = ⋂ ε > 0, ⋃ δ > 0, ⋂ r, s < δ, ⋃ L, B (L, r, s, ε)`.
In other words, for any `ε > 0`, we require that there is a size `δ` such that, for any two scales
below this size, the function is well approximated by a linear map, common to the two scales.

The set `⋃ L, B (L, r, s, ε)` is open, as a union of open sets. Converting the intersections and
unions to countable ones (using real numbers of the form `2 ^ (-n)`), it follows that the
differentiability set is measurable.

To prove the claim, there are two inclusions. One is trivial: if the function is differentiable
at `x`, then `x` belongs to `D` (just take `L` to be the derivative, and use that the
differentiability exactly says that the map is well approximated by `L`). This is proved in
`mem_A_of_differentiable` and `differentiable_set_subset_D`.

For the other direction, the difficulty is that `L` in the union may depend on `ε, r, s`. The key
point is that, in fact, it doesn't depend too much on them. First, if `x` belongs both to
`A (L, r, ε)` and `A (L', r, ε)`, then `L` and `L'` have to be close on a shell, and thus
`‖L - L'‖` is bounded by `ε` (see `norm_sub_le_of_mem_A`). Assume now `x ∈ D`. If one has two maps
`L` and `L'` such that `x` belongs to `A (L, r, ε)` and to `A (L', r', ε')`, one deduces that `L` is
close to `L'` by arguing as follows. Consider another scale `s` smaller than `r` and `r'`. Take a
linear map `L₁` that approximates `f` around `x` both at scales `r` and `s` w.r.t. `ε` (it exists as
`x` belongs to `D`). Take also `L₂` that approximates `f` around `x` both at scales `r'` and `s`
w.r.t. `ε'`. Then `L₁` is close to `L` (as they are close on a shell of radius `r`), and `L₂` is
close to `L₁` (as they are close on a shell of radius `s`), and `L'` is close to `L₂` (as they are
close on a shell of radius `r'`). It follows that `L` is close to `L'`, as we claimed.

It follows that the different approximating linear maps that show up form a Cauchy sequence when
`ε` tends to `0`. When the target space is complete, this sequence converges, to a limit `f'`.
With the same kind of arguments, one checks that `f` is differentiable with derivative `f'`.

To show that the derivative itself is measurable, add in the definition of `B` and `D` a set
`K` of continuous linear maps to which `L` should belong. Then, when `K` is complete, the set `D K`
is exactly the set of points where `f` is differentiable with a derivative in `K`.
